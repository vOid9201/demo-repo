## Information on GIT

-> for git to operated you must perform in the git repo only
-> git clone "enter the link to the git repo"
-> git status ('git status') tells us all about the files which were updated deleted and created but havenot being committed yet 
-> to have git status controlling new files we have to tell git to track them 
-> to track files we have to add them "git add ." will add all otherwise "git add 'file_name'"
-> now you can commit using "git commit -m 'title of the message , be displayed' -m "description of the message""
-> now still these are commited locally to push them to github we can use the command "git push"
